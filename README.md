# Paleocurrents
Python code for converting paleocurrent measurements and plotting in (equal-area) rose diagrams.

The current version only converts imbrication measurements, and handles one file at a time.
Updated versions increase efficiency, will handle more types of measurements (e.g. planar x-lamination, trough x-lamination) and excel files with multiple sheets.

INPUT: Excel datasheet with measurements of dip/dipdirection of paeocurrent indicators

VARIABLES: number of bins, equal-area [True/False], 

OUTPUT: Rose diagrams
